Implementation of a virtual memory.

Includes:
1) Searching through the Translation Lookaside Buffer(TLB)
2) Searching through the Inverted Page Table(IPT)
3) Actions to handle a TLB hit/miss
4) Actions to handle an IPT hit/miss
5) Least Recently Used algorithm as a page replacement policy

The 3 functions in the report are implemented by me. 
The rest of the functions are not included as they were written by the professor to help test the 3 functions in my report.
